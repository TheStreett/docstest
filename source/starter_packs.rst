Titanic Dataset
================
	"The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others." Use data about the passengers on board to determine whether they were likely to survive the shipwreck or not.

Used Car Sales Price Dataset
============================

	Cars notoriously lose value as soon as they are purchased. However, the resell value of any particular car depends on many factors, including make, model, miles driven, transmission type, the number of owners, and more. Use this dataset to predict the resell value of used cars based on their features.
